# ML-Snow-Stability

For this project, I decided to work with a dataset of 589 snow profile observations that were recorded in Switzerland. This dataset has over 100 different features within each observation which is ideal for a machine learning model.

Using this dataset I want to train a model that can accurately predict the stability level of the snow based on the data collected. This stability level is broken into 5 different classifications 1: very poor, 2: poor, 3: fair, 4: good, and 5: very good. Ideally, it would be advantageous to use a model for backcountry skiing that takes the human factor out of the decision-making. An individual could perform a snow test in the backcountry and give the data to this model. In turn, the model would give the danger level to better inform the backcountry travaler.
